Hi again folks! 

A msn messenger SERVER,pure vb6, supports mutliuser chat, blocking, screen names, away states, file transfers, net meeting, voice chat, etc.

This small code runs an msn messenger server. It allows for people who either don't want to, or can't, connect to the official MSN server, to still use MSN messenger and to talk to other people using the same server. This has never been done before, so, there are some bugs and a few missing features (namely contact list groups), but, otherwise this is great for a school, small office, or someone building an MSN client from the socket level and needs a good example. Also, wait for the screenshot to load, they are popular clients, with a quick registry/ini hack (.reg to simplify process included), connected to my server, talking to each other. Also, If you think this code is worth existance, I'd apreachiate a vote. Ashley

my hard core fans (if any), will notice a patern in my work. I first built a webserver, it won code of the month on PSC, it supported perl, php, asp, ssi, everything. My next project was a mailserver, very interesting, multiple mailboxes, webmail, smtp server, the lot. Didn't quite win code of the month (damn photoshop clone), and had some bugs, but was still a good server. well, here I am again folks, an MSN server!

Yep! are you sick of being lonerised simply because microsoft wants to repair a server? are you sick of being billed for 'internet access' cause you messaged someone in the next room? Maybe you wanted to build an inhouse IM service and are lazy? Maybe you just don't trust microsoft having a list of all your friends stored in a database? Maybe you don't want to have your username end in @hotmail.com if your company has a different dommain or you use your isps pop3 account? Maybe you just reject any company ending with 'soft' and starting with 'micro'? Whatever the reason, you can use this small (800kb source and tools, 2mb compiled with full dependancys and tools) vb6 program to replace that entire network of servers called MSN.

An advantage of this approach is that you can still use the same instant messager program. Fallen in love with those pop up buddy alerts over the task bar? Absolutely love netmeeting? You can keep it, and without even connecting to microsoft, but using the same interface.

I build a 'hack' program (in mindvision VISE) for the orignal microsoft MSN messenger, and make it connect to a different server (you type it in the box). You then open up the server on the server machine, enter the usernames/passwords into the database (access97), and run it. People then connect, add each other to each others contact list, start chating, sending files, and doing whatever you wanted them to. I've also got a version of the hacker for trillian messenger. inlcuded with the download

There is one problem, though, people who are connected to one server, can't have contacts on their buddy list from another server, including the official MSN server. Hence, this can only be used in a completely contained enviroment, if you want to chat to someone outside, you've got to use email. Also, the MSN protocol says that all user accounts must be in the form of an email address, so most clients don't let you either log in, or add users, that don't have a dommain. (my server will have no problem with it)

I built this because my school blocked the MSN server (well, actually the MSN port). So basically we wanted an IM network. so, I built one. (You guessed right, my school is called 'cabra' (screenshots))

This app stores server side contact lists, supports blocking and all the away states, screennames, multimember chat, colours/fonts/etc., 'user is typing' prompts, secure passwords, file transfers, netmeeting (untested), voice chats (untested), and any other app that works over the MSN protocol (some network games, etc). Chats are actually displayed on screen for bored admins to read.

All my apps are freeware, opensource, and free for general scavenging of code. You can use this for whatever you want it for, so long as I don't get a letter from some lawyers cause my app crashed your business. etc. Enjoy! and Vote on PSC!
